Smart Data Mediator

Smart Data Mediator is an intelligent data analysis web application built using Flask, Python, and MySQL. It allows users to upload Excel datasets, ask natural-language questions, and automatically generate insights, visualizations, and downloadable reports.

Features Automatic Chart Generation: Creates visualizations (bar, line, pie charts, etc.) for every query. Advanced NLP Understanding: Interprets user queries using natural language processing. Multiple File Upload: Supports uploading and managing multiple Excel datasets. Data Preview: Lets users preview uploaded data before analysis. MySQL Backend: Stores query history, user sessions, and results. Downloadable Reports: Generates PDF and Word reports for analyzed data. Chat with Data: Enables conversational interaction with datasets. Dashboard View: Displays charts and insights in a clean, interactive dashboard.

** Technologies Used** Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript Backend: Flask (Python) Database: MySQL Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, SQLAlchemy, NLP tools (like spaCy or NLTK)

** How It Works** Upload one or more Excel datasets. Enter a natural language query (e.g., “Show total sales by region”). The system processes the query using NLP, fetches relevant data, and visualizes results. Users can download insights as PDF or Word reports.

Purpose The Smart Data Mediator project aims to simplify data analysis by bridging the gap between human language and data logic, making analytics accessible for everyone — no coding or SQL required.

How It Works Upload your Excel dataset through the web interface.

Enter your query in natural language (e.g., “Show me total sales by region”).

The application processes the query, generates the results, and displays charts.

You can download the results or view them in the dashboard.
